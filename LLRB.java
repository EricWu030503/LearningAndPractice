/**
 * Left-Leaning Red-Black Tree (LLRB):
 *
 * Definition:
 * - A LLRB is a self-balancing binary search tree, it has one-to-one correspondence with its equivalent 2-3 tree.
 *
 * Properties:
 * 1. Red Links: Red links are only left-leaning.
 * 2. No Consecutive Red Links: Avoids consecutive red links in any path.
 * 3. Black Height Consistency: Every path from the root to a null link has the same number of black links.
 * 4. Height: Height of LLRB is logarithmic, at most ~2x height of its equivalent 2-3 tree.
 *
 * Insertion Process:
 * - Insert as usual into a BST and use zero or more rotations to maintain the 1-1 mapping.
 * - New nodes are inserted with red links.
 * - Left Leaning Violation: Rotate left to correct right-leaning red links.
 * - Incorrect 4 Node Violation: Rotate right to correct consecutive left-leaning red links.
 * - Temporary 4 Node: Color flip at nodes with two red children to emulate splitting.
 * - Cascading Operations: Additional adjustments may be needed if initial operations cause further violations.
 *
 * Performance:
 * - Guarantees logarithmic time complexity for insert, delete, and search operations.
